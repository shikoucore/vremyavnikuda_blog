A Rust-based utility and library for taking screenshots on Wayland compositors. It has no external C dependencies, supports multi-monitor setups, output transformations (rotation and mirroring), region capture, high-quality image scaling (Triangle, CatmullRom, Lanczos3), and saving to PNG/JPEG/PPM formats. Available as a CLI tool (cargo install grim-rs) and as a crate for integrating into your own applications.
