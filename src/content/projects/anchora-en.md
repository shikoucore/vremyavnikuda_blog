A VS Code extension that turns code comments into an in-editor task manager.

Anchora lets you create and track tasks right inside comments, with statuses like todo, in_progress, done, and blocked. It auto-scans files, syncs state, shows visual indicators, and provides tree views, jump-to-definition, and search for tasks and notes. There's a notes system that can generate links and auto-convert notes into tasks when they appear in code. State is stored in .anchora/tasks.json. The stack pairs a high-performance Rust backend with a TypeScript VS Code frontend, communicating via JSON-RPC. Install from the VS Code Marketplace or via VSIX.
