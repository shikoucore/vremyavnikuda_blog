# Building a Fast Blog with Astro

When deciding on a tech stack for my personal blog, performance and simplicity were my top priorities. That's why I chose [Astro](https://astro.build).

## Why Astro?

Astro is a modern static site generator that ships zero JavaScript by default. Here's why it's perfect for a blog:

### 1. Performance First

Astro generates static HTML at build time, resulting in incredibly fast page loads. No hydration cost, no large JavaScript bundles.

### 2. Component Islands

With Astro's Islands architecture, you can add interactive components only where needed:

```astro
---
import HeavyComponent from './HeavyComponent';
---

<HeavyComponent client:idle />
```

### 3. Content Collections

Type-safe content management with Zod validation makes working with MDX files a breeze.

### 4. Framework Agnostic

Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any framework - only for the components that need it.

## The Result

This blog loads in under 1 second on 3G and scores 100 on Lighthouse. That's the power of shipping less JavaScript.

## Conclusion

If you're building a content-focused website, give Astro a try. You won't regret it.
