rust-fmt 0.1.3 is a small, focused update to the VS Code extension that formats Rust code via `rustfmt`. The goal is to make the extension feel like the default with less manual setup: there is now a quick command to set rust-fmt as the formatter at the global or workspace level, and a smart prompt appears when Rust isn't using rust-fmt as the default formatter.

Workspace formatting is also faster on large projects, keeping the workflow minimal while reducing wait time.
